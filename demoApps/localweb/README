There is a script which does the following steps for you (generate.sh):

To change namespace/scheme:
 * Edit chrome.manifest and change second line (name=<scheme>)
 * Edit install.rdf and change em:name and em:homepageURL tag
 * Edit components/localweb.js (var protocol_scheme)

To build an XPI:
 * Use zip within the src folder:
   * zip -r ../localweb-<scheme>-<version>.xpi *

To install multiple extensions in parallel:
 * Generate an UUID (there are loads of web-pages for that)
 * Change UUID:
   * in chrome.manifest
   * in components/localweb.js (var component_id)
