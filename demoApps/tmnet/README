High-level, name-based network API. While its interface is generic, special
focus is on NENA support. Other frameworks and network APIs may be added later
via the plugin system. The NENA plugin, however, is currently directly
integrated (though it may be separated easily, see posix folder).

TODO: API documentation. For now, refer to

Interface", in Proceedings of the 2011 Second International Conference on the
