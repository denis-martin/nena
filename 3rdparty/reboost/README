reboost is a tribute to the well-known boost libraries (http://boost.org).

The goal of reboost is to provide independent source-code that eases 
development in manifold areas. To this end, we focus on 

  * small, elegant snippets/convenience functions,
  * efficient collections of helper classes and base-types
  
and explicitely NOT on full-fledged well-designed libraries. All source-code 
should be seen as basis for derivative work. However, we are happy to merge 
your changes. reboost follows the philosophy:

  * Nothing is perfect: Do not blame! Contribute!
  * Don't re-write! Adapt! Mash-up! Be creative!
  * Don't challenge other approaches: 
    All source-code in reboost has its own history and purpose. 
  * Nothing is static. Everything may change---anytime.

The directory structure constraints of reboost are as follows:

  1) source-codes inside a directory has no cross-dependencies. This means,
     they depend only on files inside the same directory or common libraries 
     (e.g., boost or STL).

  2) source-codes inside sub-directories has dependencies within its sub-tree 
     only. E.g., implement plugins based on the source-code.
     
  3) examples belong to an "examples" folder. Folders with plugin's or addons
     belong start with "plugin."
